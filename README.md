# The Ripper's Trail (An Arduino Physical Murder Mystery Board Game)

The Ripper's Trail is an Arduino-based alternative controller game that immerses players in the quest to unveil the identity of the infamous Jack the Ripper. As the player, you'll navigate a vast web of resources and clues, pulling threads throughout the game board to uncover the truth and identify the elusive killer. This physical mystery game utilizes the Arduino Mega and Arduino IDE, adding an innovative layer to the gaming experience as you engage with tangible clues and unravel the enigma surrounding Jack the Ripper.

As the Game Designer and Arduino Programmer, I created the backend system from scratch using the Arduino IDE and a library of resources available for Arduino to develop the ideal systems for running the game as designed. Additionally, I served as the Physical Board Engineer, drafting the design for the game's physical board and creating it in our university's (LCC) woodwork workshop.
